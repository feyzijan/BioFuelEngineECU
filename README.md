# BioFuelEngineECU
This repo houses some of the files used for designing a Biofuel Engine Control Unit as part of my Y3 Design and Manufacture Project


## PCB
This folder houses the two PCB designs that I then had manufactured with JLC PCB
Gerber Files and some images are included

## Simulink
Control system was partially modelled on Simulink. Some of the Simulink diagrams were made for visual only, and are marked as such.

## Manual & Resources
Relevant pages from the Honda CBR Manual

## Engine_Models_Cals
Some codes written to simulate the biofuel engine

## Arduino Codes
This folder has lots of codes that were used to test various functionalities of the Arduino/ECU.
This included single and multiple component tests, cooling tests, speed tests etc.
Due to the specific equipment used this code will not be very usefull for general use, so I have not bothered organising everything very clearly for now. When I have some time in the future I will make tidy this up and link everything together.
